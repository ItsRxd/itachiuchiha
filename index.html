      <h2>About Itachi</h2>
      <p>
        Itachi is a character in the anime "Naruto". He has a complex story line

      <!-- Life -->
      <h2>Itachi's Life</h2>
      <p>
        His early childhood was marked with violence: when he was four years
        old, the Third Shinobi World War waged and he witnessed first-hand many
        of the war's casualties.
      </p>
      <p>
        At age 5, after becoming a big brother to Sasuke, Itachi was approached
        by Shisui, who offered to train together. Soon, the two became best
        friends, forming a brother-like bond as they continued to teach the
        other new tricks.
      </p>
      <p>
        At age six, Itachi enrolled into the Academy, where he consistently
        scored the highest in each subject and quickly learned any skill taught
        to him, resulting in him being praised as the best of his generation.
        After four months, his teachers unanimously agreed let him take the
        graduation exam early due to Itachi being more than advanced enough for
        genin-level, which he passed later that month.
      </p>
      <p>
        Joining Team 2, Itachi went on to honing his skills to chūnin level,
        leading to him drawing the attention of Konoha's leaders. Nearly a year
        since graduating, Itachi had mastered ninjutsu to the extent his
        missions went too easy. After turning eight, as Team 2's genin had
        distinguished themselves the most during the year, they were tasked with
        guarding the Fire Daimyō during his annual trip to Konoha. During the
        mission, the convoy was attacked by a masked individual, who killed
        Tenma Izumo before Itachi, resulting in him awakening his Sharingan,
        which he mastered at the same age.
      </p>
      <p>
        At age 10, Konoha officials allowed Itachi to compete in the Chūnin
        Exams by himself, which he passed and became a chūnin.
      </p>
      <p>
        At age 11, he entered the Anbu. Itachi's accomplishments were a source
        of great pride for his family, his father viewing him as proof of the
        Uchiha's future prosperity and his brother viewing him as a model to
        live up to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, the Uchiha's disdain for their unfair treatment led them to
        plan a coup d'état. Fugaku, head of the Uchiha and the coup's chief
        conspirator, encouraged Itachi's advancement into the Anbu's ranks as a
        means of spying on the village. Itachi, however, knew an Uchiha coup
        would lead to intervention from other villages and ultimately start
        another World War, something he could not support. He instead became a
        double agent, reporting the Uchiha's actions to the Third Hokage and the
        Konoha Council in the hopes it would help them find a peaceful
        resolution
      </p>
      <p>
        Itachi shared the burden of betraying his clan with Shisui. But as time
        went on it became increasingly clear that peace could not be achieved.
        Shisui intended to use his Kotoamatsukami on the Uchiha's leaders to
        compel them to negotiate, but his right eye was stolen by Danzō before
        he had a chance. His own options exhausted, Shisui entrusted his
        remaining eye to Itachi and begged him to protect the village and their
        family name before drowning himself in the Naka River.
      </p>
      <p>
        Itachi was anguished by Shisui's death, enough to awaken his Mangekyō
        Sharingan. When the following day some Uchiha, already suspicious of
        Itachi, accused him of murdering Shisui and staging a suicide, Itachi
        lost his composure and attacked them, defeating them easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        At age 12, he was promoted to Anbu Captain, with his publicly disclosed
        promotion age being 13 due to Danzō's request and Hiruzen's acceptance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Third Hokage still wished to negotiate with the Uchiha,
        Danzō Shimura recognised that there was no longer an outcome that could
        see the Uchiha clan's survival. He explained this to Itachi and left him
        a choice: support the Uchiha's coup and have the whole clan, including
        Sasuke, killed in the ensuing conflict, or accept the assignment to wipe
        out the clan before the coup started and be allowed to spare Sasuke.
        Itachi chose his brother.
      </p>
      <p>
        In one night Itachi and Tobi slaughtered the entire clan. Itachi took it
        upon himself to personally execute his parents. Despite his betrayal,
        they bore him no ill-will, instead telling him in the moments before
        they were killed that they were proud of him and requesting that he take
        care of Sasuke.
      </p>
      <p>
        Racked by grief for his actions, Itachi saw in Sasuke the only person
        suitable to punish him for his crimes. In order to set Sasuke on this
        road he cast himself as the villain, done by allowing Sasuke to find him
        standing over their parents' bodies and using Tsukuyomi to torment him
        with visions of their murders. Sasuke fled, fearing his own death, but
        Itachi chased him down to divulge the lie he had concocted: he killed
        their family to test his mettle and now wanted to test himself against
        the only remaining challenge to him, the little brother he had never
        loved. He encouraged Sasuke to become strong enough to kill him and take
        revenge, and to that end suggested he acquire a Mangekyō Sharingan of
        his own. Itachi left, but was surprised to find Sasuke already pursuing
        him with a newly-awakened Sharingan. Sasuke's attempt at vengeance
        failed and he passed out, but not before seeing Itachi cry with remorse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Itachi left the village publicly a traitor but secretly with a new
        mission: to infiltrate Tobi's organisation, Akatsuki, and keep it from
        moving against Konoha.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though he did it for Sasuke, Itachi wanted to be punished for his
        crimes and selected Sasuke as the one to take vengeance against him. To
        push Sasuke in this direction, Itachi withheld the true reason for his
        actions and instead took on the persona of a man who had no love for his
        younger brother. Per the persona, Itachi cared about Sasuke only because
        of the eyes that he could take to gain Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan. His
        actions in Akatsuki were meant to reinforce this persona, and whenever
        he met Sasuke over the years he would taunt his weakness and encourage
        him to get strong enough to kill him. His plan was that, once he had
        been killed, Sasuke would be hailed as a hero.
